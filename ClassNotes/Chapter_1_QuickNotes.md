### INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING
‚óÜ Machine/Binary/Low Level Lang - Writing Instructions in 0's ,1's
‚óÜ Assembly Level Lang - Writing Instructions in Mnemonics
‚óÜ High Level Lang - Writing Instructions in English like statements


----------------------------
## JAVA INTRODUCTION
	-   Java is General Purpose
	-   High Level
	-   Object oriented
	-   Functional and Robust Language writing instructions in English like statements.
- We can use java for developing 
	-   Mobile application - Kotin (Android studio)
	-   Web Application - (JSP & Servlets)
	-   Enterprise application (Spring Boot)
	-   Desktop application (applets, AWT)

--------------------------------------
## WHY JAVA  INVENTED?


-   For developing **platform Independent s/w** for digital electronic languages like
-   Set up boxes , Dishes, Tape recorders,  TV's , etc
-   C , C++ was not chosen because of platform dependency nature
-   Here Platform means OS and  hardware architecture
-   OS 
		- Windows , Linux , Macintosh
-   Hardware
	- 32 bit , 64bit, Intel , AMD


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## HISTORY OF JAVA
========================================================
‚óÜ At First, java was developed only for portable devices
‚óÜ  With a team of 4 members started a project called **Green talk**   in 1991, under Sun Micro systems Company Management.
‚óÜ  Green talk project was lead by **James Gosling** ( considered as father of java)
‚óÜ Later in 1994 name was changed to OAK (national tree of USA) due to trademark issues.
In 1995 Again changed name to JAVA ,and release first beta JDK version in 1996

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Java Terminology
--------------------------------------------------

***JDK : JAVA Development Kit***
-   It is a complete Java development kit that includes everything including compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), java debuggers, java docs, etc
-   For a Program to execute/compile in local system we need to install JDK and class-path should be set after installation.
-   **JDK is platform dependent.**
-   Present Version of JDK: 21
```java	
	javac - compiler command
	java - runtime/running command
```

***JRE: JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT***

-   The Java Runtime Environment, or JRE, is a software layer that runs on top of a computer‚Äôs operating system software
-   Provides the class libraries and other resources that a specific Java program needs to run.
-   `JRE is a part of JDK`
-   **JRE is platform dependent**

***Java Virtual Machine(JVM):***

-   JVM(Java Virtual Machine) acts as a run-time engine to run Java applications.
-   JVM is the one that actually calls the main method present in a java code.
-   **JVM is a part of JRE(Java Runtime Environment).**
-   **JVM is also platform dependent.**

#### *Bytecode*

-   The Javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM
- It is saved as .class file by the compiler.
-   To view the bytecode, a disassembler like **javap** can be used.
-   **`Byte Code can be defined as an intermediate code generated by the compiler after the compilation of source code(JAVA Program). This intermediate code makes Java a platform-independent language`**.

#### *ClassPath:*

-   The classpath is the **file path where the java runtime and Java compiler look for .class files** to load.
-   By default, JDK provides many libraries. If you want to include external libraries they should be added to the classpath.

-----------------------------------------------
## Primary/Main Features of Java.
1.  Platform independent
2.  Object oriented Language
3.  Simple & Secure & Robust
4.  Distributed
5.  Multi threading
6.  Portable , WORA (write once run anywhere)
7.  Compiled and interpreted

------------------------------

### STRUCTURE OF JAVA PROGRAM
1.  Comments/documentation
2.  Package statements
3.  Import statements
4.  Class declaration:
	- Static variable & methods
	-  Instance variables & methods
	- Local variables inside methods

üî¥IMPORTANT‚ùóüî¥
 **Ever thing must be inside class declaration only in java.**


------------------------------------

### FIRST PROGRAM
--------------------------------------
```java
// Importing classes from packages
import java.io.*;

// Main class
public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String[] args) // Main driver method
	{
		System.out.println("Welcome to Java World"); // Print statement
	}
}
```

***Comments***

- // Single line comment

- /* Multi line comments*/

***import java.io.*:***

-   This means all the classes of io package can be imported.
-   Java io package provides a set of input and output streams for reading and writing data to files or other input or output sources.

***class:***

-   The class contains the data and methods to be used in the program.
-   Methods define the behaviour of the class

***static void main():***

-   static keyword tells us that this method is accessible without instantiating the class.

***void:***

-   keywords tell that this method will not return anything.
-   The main() method is the entry point of our application.

***System.in:***

-   This is the standard input stream that is used to read characters from the keyboard or any other standard input device.
-   System is a class from java.lang package

***System.out:***

-   This is the standard output stream that is used to produce the result of a program on an output device like the computer screen.

***println():***

-   This method in Java is also used to display text on the console.
-   It prints the text on the console and the cursor moves to the start of the next line at the console.
-   The next printing takes place from the next line.

***String []args:***

-   This is the argument passed to the main function which is an array of strings with the array name args.
- Useful for command line arguments while running.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TWO PHASES IN A JAVA PROGRAM
‚óÜ Compilation phase
		**javac - compiler**
	```
	javac fileName.java
	```

‚óÜ Execution phase.
**java - runtime tool**

```java
java bytecodeName or .className
```

---------------------------------------------------------
üî¥IMPORTANT OBSERVATION‚ùóüî¥

üî• **javac** (Java Compiler) will take care all java syntax checking and generates
BYTECODE

üî• **JVM will load byte code into the memory** and start execution from the **main()**
method.

üî• The Order of **public static** can be written in different ways

```java
public  static  void main(String[] args)
static  public  void  main(String[] args)
strictfp  final  public  static  void  main(String[] args)
```
üî• String[] args can be written in different ways 

```java
	String[] args
	String []args
	String args[]
	String... args
``` 
- We can use any meaning variable name as part of **args**
‚û¢ static keyword tells us that this **method is accessible without instantiating the
class.**
‚û¢ System.in & System.out are **Standard Input & Output Streams.**
‚û¢ System is a class belonging to **java.lang** and in & out objects belong to
**PrintStream** class.
‚û¢ String []args : used for reading the command line args/values while running
the program.

üî• **JDK(JVM+JRE) is platform dependent** because each OS will have different
instruction sets.

üî• **ByteCode is PLATFORM INDEPENDENT** ,which makes Java as a platform
independent language.

üî• **We can compile a class without a main method() & String[] args** , but we cannot run , it will raise a
Runtime Exception.

üî• When a class is public **, java fileName must be the same as className.**- 
- When class is not public.
‚û¢ **compile with fileName**
‚û¢**run with className**
 üî¥By default it will generate a bytecode with className having main() method


üî• It is Possible to have **multiple classes in one file , it will create multiple .class files.**
üî•  Whenever we have multiple .class files while running , execute with individual names.
				
				java A
				java B

üî• **Mark & Sweep is an algorithm** used by garbage collector to delete unused variables.
üî• **HashCode** : Unique identification number allocated to objects by JVM.
üî• JAVA is **case sensitive** and follows **UNICODE character representation.**

----------------------------
## VARIABLES
---------------------
- Variable is a **primary unit of storage container to store the values.**
- Variable is name to the memory location address in which value is store.
- Variables posses variability property, which means changes value during execution.

Syntax:
```
type variableName = value;
```
```java
int myNum = 5;
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;
char myLetter = 'D';
boolean myBool = true;
String myText = "Hello";
```
